Take a look at this video:

This is the source code to the project that is featured in the video.

There are two parts to put this together: one is Processing sketchbook (http://processing.org/).  The Java application sets up a socket which listens for special UDP packets to draw on the screen.

Here's the assignment:

- Get the Processing sketchbook to start.  You will need to download and install the framework from Processing.org.  You may need to move around some of the libraries if you are on Windows.  The error messages are pretty helpful but it's the ocd and udp directories that have to move.  Open it in Processing and click start.  You should see a globe (there will be an error message about not being able to open a socket, that's fine for a moment).  Cool, now close it.

- Replay the packets to have them draw on the globe.  Determine what your local address is.  Let's assume that it's 172.16.30.141 and the MAC address is f8:1e:df:ea:98:23.  Change data/receive.txt to your local address (it's currently 172.16.30.141).  Now start up the globe and you shouldn't receive an error message.  If you are on Window, you need cygwin and some other directions.  Those are attach directions for Windows and OS X.  The basic idea is to play back the pcap files on the interface that the globe is listening on.  If you do it right, the globe lights up.

- Right now, the color is based on what's in the tcpreplay (it's a UDP packet that has coordinate information, but we'll get to that later).  Your job is to make it based on distance from the point it is answered.  The goal is to get a mix of red and green points with red being further away (color choice is not important here, you could do it based on color saturation or brightness or anything else).

OS X DynViz Packet Replay Directions

If you are on OS X, you only need to have two interfaces connected (you cannot use the loopback device on OS X).  You need tcpreplay which you can install from source or from Darwin ports (http://tcpreplay.darwinports.com/) or (http://tcpreplay.synfin.net/wiki/Download)  Then once you have that all setup, type this:

sudo tcpreplay-edit --dstipmap="216.146.45.41/32:192.168.1.146/32" --loop=0 --intf1="en1" --enet-dmac="f8:1e:df:ea:98:23" --enet-smac="f8:1e:df:ea:98:23" --fixcsum dynviz6-15.pcap


Windows DynViz Packet Replay Directions

1.	Install Cygwin
	Packages
	gcc
	libtool
	vim
	make
2.	Install Win32 tcpreplay requirements
	WinPcap
	WinPcap Developer's Pack Important! Install to C:\cygwin\WpdPack
	In /usr/include/sys/socket.h of the Cygwin environment, add the following lines to get passed IPv6 build errors of tcpreplay:

	#define AF_INET6 0
	#define INET6_ADDRSTRLEN 0

3.	Follow the Win32 build procedure for tcpreplay itself. The version tested to be good was 3.4.2.

4.	Use the attached capture .pcap file. It contains about 10 minutes of recorded data destined for 216.146.45.41 (the office DynViz).

5.	Install and enable the Microsoft Loopback Adapter
	Assign an IP of 10.0.0.250, and a subnet of 255.255.255.0
  
6.	Add a firewall exception for 10.0.0.250

7.	Manually using tcpreplay-edit:

	Use the following commands to figure out how to send the data:

	a.	tcpreplay --listnics

			i.	Use the output of this command to determine the network interface alias that Cygwin uses, typically either %1 or %2.

			ii.	Get the Ethernet MAC address of the loopback adapter, and add to both source and destination mac

			b.	tcpreplay-edit --dstipmap="216.146.45.41/32:10.0.0.250/32" --loop=0 --intf1="%1" --enet-dmac="02:00:4c:4f:4f:50" --enet-smac="02:00:4c:4f:4f:50" --fixcsum dynviz6-15.pcap

Additional notes:
1.	Make sure to update receive.txt if IP changes
2.	Reboot after adding the loopback adapter
3.	UDP port 26462 - firewalled?
4.	Update designation of NIC as "NIC %2"
